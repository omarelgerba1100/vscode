            Fyodor Dostoyevsky, in full Fyodor Mikhaylovich Dostoyevsky,
            Dostoyevsky also spelled Dostoevsky, (born November 11 [October 30,
            Old Style], 1821, Moscow, Russia—died February 9 [January 28, Old
            Style], 1881, St. Petersburg), Russian novelist and short-story
            writer whose psychological penetration into the darkest recesses of
            the human heart, together with his unsurpassed moments of
            illumination, had an immense influence on 20th-century fiction.
            Dostoyevsky is usually regarded as one of the finest novelists who
            ever lived. Literary modernism, existentialism, and various schools
            of psychology, theology, and literary criticism have been profoundly
            shaped by his ideas. His works are often called prophetic because he
            so accurately predicted how Russia’s revolutionaries would behave if
            they came to power. In his time he was also renowned for his
            activity as a journalist.
