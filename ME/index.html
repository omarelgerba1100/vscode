          Wednesday marked the day of Sultan Abdülhamid II’s death in 1918. More
          than a century, 103 years to be exact, has passed since the sultan’s
          death, but the influence of the groundbreaking reformist sultan who
          ruled and kept the ailing Ottoman Empire strong for 33 years, can
          still be felt in modern institutions of the republic. According to
          historical sources, Abdülhamid II, the son of Sultan Abdülmecid, was
          born in Istanbul on Sept. 21, 1842. Growing up in the Ottoman palace,
          he was fluent in many languages, including French, Arabic and Persian.
          His childhood and youth coincided with the “Tanzimat,” a period of
          reform in the Ottoman Empire that began in 1839.
